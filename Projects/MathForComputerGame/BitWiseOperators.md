## Bit Flags
- Bit values used to represent multitude values are called Bit Flags
```
    bool hasMagic = true;
    bool hasIntelligence = false;
    bool hasCharisma = true;
    bool canFly = false;
    bool isInvisible = true;
```
## Bitwise Operators
- ### bitwise AND 
    - Takes two numbers and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1
- ### bitwise OR 
    - Takes two numbers and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 is any of the two bits is 1
- ### bitwise XOR 
    - Takes two number and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different
- ### bitwise NOT
    - Takes two numbers and inverts all bit of it
